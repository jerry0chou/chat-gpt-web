# ChatGPTWeb

### Brief Intro
An online chatroom for ChatGPT api using React
 
### Intention
- Initially, I was inspired by one of my colleagues who passionately shared his approach to invoke OpenAI api
- Then, I perceived that I was able to build a web app to interact with GPT for individual use.
- Before that, people living in restrictive network regions are easily constrained by openAI official requirements when conversing with chatGPT due to malicious usage or a surge of user access.
- Therefore, I made an attempt to construct this project to assist people who are in need of a chatbot to talk to.
